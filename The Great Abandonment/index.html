        <h2>Chapter 1: The Great Abandonment</h2> 
        <p>The sky wasn't black; it was the color of a fresh bruise—deep purples and sickly oranges, choked with the first taste of the ash. Elara stood on the roof of the "Signal Nest," her boots crunching on a thin layer of grey grit that hadn't been there two hours ago...</p>
        <p>She opened the junction box at the tower's base. The modern digital relays were already flickering, overwhelmed by the electromagnetic interference of the shifting atmosphere. They were too delicate, too "smart" for a world that was becoming "dumb." With a practiced flick, Elara began bypassing the circuit boards. She was building a bridge made of vacuum tubes and raw voltage—something that could punch through the coming fire.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Chapter 2: The Static Cradle</h2>
        <p>The world didn't end with a bang; it ended with a cough. Three days had passed since the Great Abandonment. The massive eruptions that were supposed to turn the crust into a molten marble had sputtered into a series of jagged, violent gasps...</p>
        <p>"Cape Town, this is Oakhaven! I hear you! You’re coming through at a strength of three. Who is this?"</p>
        <p>"...name is Elias," the voice crackled, sounding thin and exhausted but undeniably alive. "...thought... I was the only one left. The ships... they're gone, Elara. They really left us."</p>
        <p>"They left us," Elara confirmed, her eyes landing on her heavy soldering iron, still hot on the bench. "But they left the keys in the ignition, Elias. And they left the people who know how to fix things."</p>
